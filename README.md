### Description
----------
sporeInput replaces native checkbox inputs and radio buttons with easily stylable anchor elements that can instantly be hooked up to your sprite sheet.


sporeSelect replaces native select dropdowns with a fully stylable unordered list appended to the body to ensure it'll never ruin your beautiful layouts.

sporeRating adds a rating metre to your forms which grows to the mouse hover point. A click will set the rating and amend any form element value that needs to accomodate.



### Usage
----------

#### sporeInput
* Include the scripts in your head then execute 'run_sporeInput()' on document ready.
* Add 'data-spore="0"' to any elements you do not want affected by the script.
* Active class indicator: '.checked'

#### sporeSelect
* Include the scripts in your head then execute 'run_sporeSelect()' on document ready.
* Change the default dropdown text by adding an option with the value of 'label'.
* Add 'data-spore="0"' to any elements you do not want affected by the script.
* Active class indicator: '.active'

#### sporeRating
* Add the attribue 'data-spore-rating' to any unordered list containing anchor elements.
* Add an attribute of 'data-id' to match the value of an input field's (of that id) value with that of the sporeRating value.
* Active class indicator: '.active'

Style to your hearts content. Why not throw some CSS3 animations on the active states of these badboys.
