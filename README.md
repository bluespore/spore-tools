@description:
Replaces native select dropdowns with a fully stylable unordered list appended 
to the body to ensure it'll never ruin your beautiful layouts.

@usage:
Just execute 'run_sporeSelect' on document ready.
Change the default text by adding an option with the value of 'label'.
Add 'data-spore="0"' to any elements you do not want affected by the script.
Style to your hearts content. Why not throw some CSS3 animations on that badboy's
active state?

@recognise:
It'd be rad if you tweeted at me to show appreciation.
