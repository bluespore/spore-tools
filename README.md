Description
----------
sporeCheck replaces native checkbox inputs and radio buttons with easily stylable anchor elements that can instantly be hooked up to your sprite sheet.


sporeSelect replaces native select dropdowns with a fully stylable unordered list appended to the body to ensure it'll never ruin your beautiful layouts.



Usage
----------
Just include the scripts in your head then execute 'run_sporeSelect()' and/or 'run_sporeCheck()' on document ready respectively.

Change the default dropdown text by adding an option with the value of 'label'.

Add 'data-spore="0"' to any elements you do not want affected by the script.

Style to your hearts content. Why not throw some CSS3 animations on that badboy's active state?
